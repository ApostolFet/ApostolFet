### 🐍 Backend Developer | Python Enthusiast
By day, I’m a backend developer wrangling Python into submission. By night, I’m an open-source contributor, slowly but surely making my mark on projects that keep the tech world spinning.

I have years of commercial experience in backend development, but recently, I decided to take my passion further and contribute to open source. It’s been an exciting ride—few things feel as rewarding as seeing your code help a larger community!
